What is VodApp? - just deploy your app from github repository and have a look :)

is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps

An app starts impacting the world when customers start interacting with it. Getting apps out in the wild, out onto the Internet quickly, and iterating, fast, is what can make or break companies.
